DAoC-Auto-Twister
=================

Play a Paladin class on DAoC and twist your chants automatically while running.

Compile in Eclipse or export as Runnable JAR file, no additional librarys needed.

To use:
After starting program, set the chants you want to use.  You can enter keys 0-9 and also use modifiers of ctrl or alt.  Enter as many keys as you prefer (up to the max of 10). Select a slot and press Backspace to remove entirely.  Press 'Start twisting' when ready.

WARNING: When you start twisting it will start spamming those keys on the selected window, until it is turned off.  When in game, press Enter to easily 'pause' the twisting.
Alt-tab out and click stop twisting to end the program.

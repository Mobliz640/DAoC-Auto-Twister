DAoC-Auto-Twister
=================

Windows desktop app that allows you to play a Paladin class on Dark Age of Camelot MMORPG and twist your chants automatically without having to tire out your fingers.

Compile in Eclipse or export as Runnable JAR file, no additional librarys needed.

To use:
After starting program, set the chants you want to use.  You can enter keys 0-9 and also use modifiers of ctrl or alt.  Enter as many keys as you prefer (up to the max of 10). Select a slot and press Backspace to remove entirely.  Press 'Start twisting' when ready.

WARNING: When you start twisting it will start spamming those keys on the selected window, until it is turned off.  When in game, press Enter to easily 'pause' the twisting.
Alt-tab out and click stop twisting to end the program.
